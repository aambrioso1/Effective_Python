Code and notes from Brett Slatkin's Effective Python (2nd Edition)

This book offers insight into writing Python code, but more importantly, it gives insight into how to write clear code.   The book also teaches about writing ABOUT code.   An example is the nice phrase "visually noisy."   

An other thing I really like about the book is that Slatkin explains his choices.  The section on interpolated f-strings (Item 4) is an excellent example of this.   In that section, Slatkin shows precisely what advantages using f-strings has over other ways of formatting in Python.  This habit helps the reader learn to handle coding decisions beyond the specific examples given in the book.

All the code, along with some nice improvements, for Slatkin's book can be found here:

One nice improvement in the GitHub code is the use of try/except/else so that the code for each item will run even when the point of the code is too show an error.
