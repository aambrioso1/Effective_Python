Code and notes from Brett Slatkin's Effective Python (2nd Edition)

This book offers insight into writing Python code, but more importantly, it gives insight
into how to write clear code.   The book also teaches about writing ABOUT code using phrases like 
"visually noisy."   

Omething I really like about the book is that Slatkin explains his choices.  The section of interpolated f-strings is interesting in that Slatkins shows precisely what advantages using them has over other ways of formatting in Python.  This habit helps the reader learn to handle coding decisions in beyond the specific examples given in the book.

All the code, along with some nice improvements, for Slatkin's book can be found here:
